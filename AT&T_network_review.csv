"This company needs to get its act together. I don't know how such a large company is so disorganized. If you call them for support, you'll get transferred at least two times, minimum, before someone is able to help you. You'll hear common phrases such as, ""This request needs to go to our East Coast division."" ""Sorry, the number you called is for Enterprise Support, but this account is supported under Small Business support."" ""No, I can't transfer you."" When it comes to support, the only hope you can have is if you have a few personal contacts from AT&T you can blast an email to when something goes wrong.",-1,Negative

"Self-driving carts Internal systems of airborne vehicles such as brakes, control vehicles and emergency situations. In traditional networks, a device sends a data information hundreds of kilometers away. It takes time to move data across large physical distances. As a result, delays may occur. With Edge computing, critical functions can be processed in real time on the edge of the network. Verita from secondary systems such as updating the car's maps or being in-car infotainment can be processed in the cloud.",1,Positive
"Great Experience. We honestly have not had any issues. If we ever come across any questions, customer service is knowledgeable.  AT&T also made it very easy to switch from our previous provider. ",1,Positive
"Great sales experience, good implementation experience, terrible Support.  All is good until you need support. Count on hold times longer than a hour, support personnel that don't know what there talking about, and resolutions that for any other company take less than a hour be up to 24 hours with AT&T.  Not a good choice for any SMB as your priority will be but a drip out of an entire ocean. We have multiple location in the United States so I deal with many telecom vendors and by far AT&T's support performance rates last on the list. ",-1,Negative

"Overall, AT&T provides the network services that I need but their customer service majorly lacks.

The pricing is steep compared to other vendors. The overall customer service is good; whenever we have needed technical support they have been more than helpful.,1,Positive
"Internet connection is flaky. I've had At&T for a number of years but since starting, my connections have been problematic.",-1,Negative

We have a lot of problems with invoices and account management.

We have requested links termination since 2 years ago and we are still receiving invoices.",-1,Negative
Technical services are OK and relatively stable but the supplier is slow to bring forward innovation and commercially change can be difficult,-1,Negative
Service works very well once it is installed.  Processing orders was very time consuming with some circuits taking very long to get in place.  Some of that is due to physical site locations.,-1,Negative
Lack of communication and understanding of installation steps.,-1,Negative

MPLS provisioning was delayed for two months for many reasons. This delayed has caused an impact on our business operational effectiveness.  Local account team and management do not have a sense of urgency and lack of customer focus.  The project was completed after escalation to the AT&T executive management team.,-1,Negative
AT&T AVPN solutions have provide our clinics and smaller facilities for remote access back to primary and secondary data centers and wide area networks solution..      the Cost  and network speeds are impressive.   we use data circuits at our facilities from this vendor and they are a great provider of  high speed and capacity for needs..,1,Positive

Chosing a managed service was an excellent option.  It was not core capability of the infrastrcure team.,1,Positive

AT&T in this latest engagement has improved in terms of flexibility and cost concessions.,1,Positive

Good experience.,1,Positive
"The MPLS service is solid. The current account team is solid. The implementation team is not well versed in communication. Sources indicate European or Asian outsourcing which cause a communication delay going either direction. The project status for the first three migrations had to be requested throughout the project so far. I had to constantly ask for updates weekly and when dates changed, we did not know about it until I asked, plus the 24+ hour later delayed response. Once the circuits were brought up, the service is solid. Based on negations of cost and credit, we are able to overlook the slow to communicate issue while receiving faster pipes, at a reduced cost to the Opex budget.",1,Positive
"The service is functional and stable, ordering and billing are obtuse.",-1,Negative
